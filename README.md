GeoMessages is a Python Server and Phone Gap iOS app for leaving messages forfriends in a geo boxed locations.The premise is that you can leave "mounment" or "temporary" messages whereveryou go, and friends can then see them when they visit. The messages cancontain text and a video or photo.Such uses would be to take a picture of a view at hte place where you proposedto your wife, that's a "Monument" and something your friends would be interestedin seeing.Temporary messages would be maybe a picture of you and your friends at a bar,"What a great night!" when you go bakc, you'll see that message and get a goodlaugh. Or your friends will. Whatevs.In addition, I'm thinking this could be useful for organizations that want topromote "info guides" type things. When you visit the zoo, maybe you can seemessages from the Zoo about the monkeys when you're near the Monkey cage.Possibilities are pretty nifty.I think it'd be a good idea to actually make native versions of the iOS andAndroid apps.This app isn't finished, it's a work in progress when I get time. But try itout!
